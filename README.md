# The VGOGTE Parallel Benchmarks in C++
Cloned from https://github.com/ioanev/vgogte/tree/master/ARGO and modified to add selective coherence options, bulk lock allocation.
There is no official repository available.

## Implementations

**ARGO** - This directory contains the parallel ArgoDSM version of the benchmarks.

## Benchmarks

```sh
Concurrent queue (CQ) - Insert/Delete nodes in a queue
Array Swap (SPS)      - Random swap of array elements
Persistent Cache (PC) - Update entries in persistent hash table
RB-tree               - Insert/Delete nodes in RB-Tree (Note: Not fully implemented or tested!)
TATP                  - Update location trans. from TATP
TPCC                  - New Order trans. from TPCC
```

## Software Requirements

**Modified version of ARGO** - Assumes you have already installed the ArgoDSM version in this repository. Main [argodsm](https://github.com/etascale/argodsm) repository.


## Building

Enter the directory from the version desired and execute:
```sh
$ cd <benchmark_name>
$ make
```

## Executing

Run each benchmark:
```sh
$ (mpirun $OMPIFLAGS) ./binary_name
```

Each benchmark can also be configured with the number of threads (`NUM_THREADS`), number of operations per thread (`NUM_OPS`), enabling the selective coherence mechanisms (`SELECTIVE_ACQREL`) etc.. The benchmarks also have specific parameters, such as number of sub operations per operation, number of sub elements per datum, etc.

Some benchmarks also allow for the bulk allocation of lock flags through the parameter (`MOD_ARGO`).
